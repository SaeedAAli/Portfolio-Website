This project is the a website that I made which was being used for my Diploma for the first year of my college course, essentially this project uses HTML, CSS to load the information but also include some interactivity with it so that It's more presentable with it.
In this project, I chose Node.js with Express.js and EJS because they allow for a fast, minimalistic setup, making the application more efficient and easier to maintain.
